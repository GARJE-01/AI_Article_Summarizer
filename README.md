# AI_Article_Summarizer

AI Article Summarizer is a Chrome extension that uses Google's Gemini AI to generate concise summaries of any article you visit online. It helps you quickly understand long articles by providing:

**Brief Summary** : A short overview capturing the main idea.

**Detailed Summary** : A thorough explanation covering all key points.

**Bullet Point Summary** : Easy-to-read highlights for quick scanning.

This extension extracts the text content from the article page and sends it to the Gemini AI API, then displays the AI-generated summary in a user-friendly popup.
